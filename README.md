## Requirements / Purpose

-   Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio. Throughout my programming journey at \_Nology, I will be gradually compiling my portfolio page by using the tech stacks and skills I learn on the way. Use my portfolio to gain an insight into my background, tech skills and projects.
-   This was our first Nology project. The aim of the project was to consolidate our learning of HTML, CSS/Sass and BEM naming, page responsiveness, practice using GitHub repos and the command line.
-   I've created this project using HTML, CSS/Sass and a bit of JavaScript.

## Design Goals / Approach

-   I've implemented a single page website with a clean, simple design/colour palette in consideration of the user experience.
-   As per the MVP, the site has the following sections: landing page, about me, tech skills, projects, contact section.

## Future Goals

-   Add some landing page feature to make it more eye catching.

## What did you struggle with?

-   Using flex properties and media queries to make page responsive. Prior to commencing the project, I had limited experience with creating page responsiveness. Throughout the process of implementing the styling, my overall ability with SCSS improved, including importing modules and partials and using flex properties.
